Say you want to install a new package in R, but you get an error:
> library(vcd)
Error in library(vcd) : there is no package called 'vcd'
> install.packages("vcd")
--- Please select a CRAN mirror for use in this session ---
Error: Line starting '<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLI ...' is malformed!

Also, the GUI for selecting a mirror on XQuartz 11 didn't work for me either.

1. Restart R

2. type in your console:
    chooseCRANmirror(81)

3. You'll get a list of mirrors. I wanted an HTTP mirror so I entered 21 in my console.
